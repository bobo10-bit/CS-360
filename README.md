Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirements and goals of this app were to build an app that allowed the user to log in and access an inventory management database. The app required the user to first create an account then use the account to log in. After logging in, the user can add item names and quantities to keep track of item inventories. The user can add, delete, and edit the item name and numbers. This app allows the user to keep track of inventory for buissnesses and personal use.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The project required two screens, one for logging in and one for keeping inventory. The login screen allows the user to create an account and to login to the created account. The inventory screen allows the user to create, delete, and edit inventory. I created a simple UI by only adding in necessary buttons and text so that the screen looks simple and clean. My designs are successful because by keeping it simple it allows the user to navigate the app easily.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
When creating the app, I made sure to code in sections. I first started with the login screen and adding in each function separately, such as first creating the register user function first then the login function. As I work through the app, I make sure to test it so that no bugs appear. This strategy was useful because it allowed me to focus on each function separately instead of trying to add in each function at once. These techniques can be used in the future by using them in other projects.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested the app by inputting different inputs, such as numbers and letters, into the item name and count. I also tested to make sure that each function worked properly without errors. If an error or function didn't work, I fixed it, then tested until it worked the way I wanted it to work. This process is important because it allows me to make sure the functions I want to implement are working so that the user can use the app without issue.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
From the initial to the finalization, I had to innovate to fix some issues. One example of this is with my first design, I used a delete button to delete any inventory input, but when I tried to implement the feature I wasn't able to get it to work, so instead of adding in a button I made it so that everytime a user enters a item it would create the button next the item based on the list.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
One specific component I was particularly successful was with input checking. If the user tried to enter invalid information or tried to log in without proper credentials, it would tell them. I the user didn't enter an login or left a field blank, then it would tell them and not allow them to log in till they fix it.
